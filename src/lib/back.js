// System back - Android's back button and gesture, the edge swipe in an iPhone
// Home Screen app, the browser's Back - does what the screen's own Back does:
// it closes an open sheet, else a layer over the screen by its
// own close button ([data-back]), else taps the top bar's Back, which follows
// the app's history (lib/nav.js), else a tab goes to Wallet (Activity,
// Settings, and the Ethereum side). Any other screen without a Back (Wallet,
// Welcome, Unlock, a payment's status, a step that must finish) stays. On a
// screen still loading, it waits for its Back. The Back is found by data-nav,
// never by its label, which is translated.
//
// The browser's history holds one entry for each step a Back can take: the
// screens of the app's history, Wallet under a tab, and each sheet or layer
// open over the screen. Opening one adds an entry; going back, by the app's
// own Back too, goes back over them. The address never changes and nothing
// about a screen is kept in the browser. This is for the swipe: Safari shows a
// picture of the entry it goes back to, taken as that entry was left, so the
// picture is the screen the Back opens. (With entries added once, at the first
// touch, it showed the screen of that touch, often Unlock: owner, 2026-10-27.)
//
// Wallet, Welcome and Unlock are the first entry: a Back there leaves the app
// in a browser tab, and has nothing to go back to in a Home Screen app. Unless
// entries of an earlier page of this app lie under it (a reload keeps them),
// where a Back would start the app again at Unlock: then one entry is kept
// under the first screen and a Back onto it stays.
//
// What the browsers allow (audit of 0.1.16 / 0.2.21):
// - Chrome skips, on the person's Back, entries a page added with no tap since
//   its last Back; Safari, entries added more than 10 s after a tap (and the
//   one before: no worse than no entry). Skipped, the app's entries are passed
//   over and the earlier page loads: Unlock again. So an entry is never added
//   after a Back with no tap since; a Back that changes nothing steps forward
//   again onto the entry it left (a traversal marks nothing); other entries
//   wait for the next tap (counted when the finger lifts, as Chrome does).
// - A picture is taken of whatever is painted when an entry is left, and it
//   stays with the entry, ahead of it too. Recovery words, keys and codes must
//   not stay in one: an entry left while they were painted (by the app or by
//   the person's swipe) is stepped onto and off again once they are gone from
//   the screen, which takes its picture anew; so is the entry under a screen
//   that stays (its picture is that screen, not what was before it).
